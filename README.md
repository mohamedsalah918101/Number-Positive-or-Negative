# Check Number

This Dart program checks whether an integer number is:

* **Positive**
* **Negative**
* **Even**
* **Odd**

**Usage:**

1. Run the Dart program.
2. Enter an integer number when prompted.
3. The program will output whether the entered number is positive, negative, even, or odd.

**Code Explanation:**

The code uses `if-else` statements to determine the number's characteristics:

* **Positivity/Negativity:** 
    * If the number is greater than 0, it's positive.
    * If the number is less than 0, it's negative.
    * Otherwise, it's zero.
* **Evenness/Oddness:** 
    * If the number is divisible by 2 (remainder is 0), it's even.
    * Otherwise, it's odd.

**Note:**

This is a basic example. You can enhance it by:

* Adding input validation to ensure the user enters a valid integer.
* Creating a more user-friendly interface.
* Implementing more complex logic for different number classifications.
